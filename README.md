Will another Initial Coin Offering alleviate global poverty? Does the world need a new protocol to avoid an environmental catastrophe? 

This course will take a contrarian view and start with a social, environmental, political, or cultural problem. Only then will we look at applicable technologies, inventions, and tools to make an impact. We will present an overview of blockchain, fintech, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, and other disruptive technologies that have the potential to transform society or reinvent markets. Students will also learn the basics of entrepreneurship and deploy empathy-driven, user-centered design methods to create a new product and ensure a good problem / solution fit. Guest lectures from industry and academia, hands-on group exercises, and presentation of use cases will help along the way.

The course is structured as an incubator where multidisciplinary student teams will work together on real world deliverables.  Over the course of the semester, students will be expected to validate their initial ideas with users, build and launch a working prototype, and develop and present a cogent business plan. At the conclusion of the course, each team will pitch their idea to a panel of venture capitalists and angel investors.  The top teams will have the opportunity to transition their companies into one or more Berkeley-related incubator/accelerator programs, including the Blockchain Accelerator.
