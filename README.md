6. Steps Going Forward

In `Climate Data.ipynb`:
     We looked at CO2 emissions data from NOAA and the EU. 
     
     After fetching/downloading in a zipfile, parsing and cleaning the csv files,and creating interesting plots with dataframes from the pandas library, we applied the simple least squares algorithm to find a best fit line to "predict" trends in Carbon Emission Sources.
